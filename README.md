# react-cv

## Summary
A single page reactive CV that is printable and exportable to PDF. Built with React + React Materials.

## Raison d'Ãªtre
My previous CV was made using LaTeX using a ready made template with very bad code and no comments, which caused a lot of headaches whenever I wanted to make any changes to the layout, icons or even the text. So I decided to create a HTML website (which I intend to host on the internet) that should be very easy do modify, both the layout and the internationalized data. As an added bonus it gives me a chance to practice React in a frontend only environment since all the data is statically loaded from the project files.
